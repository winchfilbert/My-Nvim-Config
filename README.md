<p>Notes:
<li> you can also find the color of the Nordic theme in vscode through finding it in the extensions / search by using the color theme search bar </li>
<li> the Rust analyzer were from the official RustUp which can be downloaded through CLI or it's official website, <br> make sure to download the rust first before using the config</br> </li>
<li> if you want to use the gopls which is the official lsp for GoLang, please download the Go first which can be downloaded through either CLI or official website </li>
<li> none-ls (which is now the current name of null-ls) were set up for external linters such as prettier </li>
<li> if you are trying to clone this for windows, you might find yourself having problem with errors like build tools, gcc not configured, etc. Make sure there's msvc (which can be acquired with downloading visual studio and do some certain configuration) and gcc (which is crucial for the treesitter) installed, you should have this config works on windows perfectly</li>
<li> please don't use default CMD (if you are using like windows 10). Use the windows Terminal  if you find yourself having problem / difficulties with the configuration. Since CMD not asynchronously updated it's path or the system environment variables. Please refer to Microsoft Store's Windows Terminal</li>
